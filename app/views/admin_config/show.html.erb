              From this page you'll be able to manage the available series and copy over the episodes for a series.

              Because copying over all the episodes from thetvdb.com might take a while, we've opted to split the process into two parts.
              First you add a series to the available series list on the right side of the screen by clicking the link below and searching for a series, then you copy over the episodes by clicking the 'Get episodes' button.
            </p>
            <%= link_to "Copy over a series from thetvdb.com", "/admin_config/search" %>
          </div>
    </div>
    <%= render :partial => "shared/series_block" %>
</div>
